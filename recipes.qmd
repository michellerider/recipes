#### **Ingredients:**

-   2 ripe avocados

-   1/4 cup cocoa powder (unsweetened)

-   1/4 cup maple syrup or agave nectar (adjust to taste)

-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

-   A pinch of salt

-   Optional toppings: fresh berries, shredded coconut, chopped nuts

#### **Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Avocados**: Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop out the flesh into a blender or food processor.

2.  **Blend**: Add cocoa powder, maple syrup or agave nectar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to the blender or food processor.

3.  **Blend Until Smooth**: Blend all the ingredients until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender or food processor a few times to ensure everything is well combined.

4.  **Adjust Sweetness**: Taste the mousse and adjust the sweetness if necessary by adding more maple syrup or agave nectar.

5.  **Chill**: Transfer the mousse into serving bowls or glasses and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow it to chill and firm up a bit.

6.  **Serve**: Once chilled, serve the mousse with your favorite toppings like fresh berries, shredded coconut, or chopped nuts.
